/**
 * @file data/priority_queue.h
 * @brief Fixed-capacity binary min-heap (priority queue) with caller-owned buffer
 *
 * A PriorityQueue is a binary min-heap backed by a flat contiguous buffer.
 * The element with the lowest comparator value is always at the top.
 * Use a descending comparator for max-heap behavior.
 *
 * Core ideas:
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * - Fixed capacity — no dynamic growth, no hidden allocation
 * - Caller owns the backing buffer (stack, arena, static, etc.)
 * - Min-heap by default; pass a descending comparator for max-heap
 * - O(log n) push/pop, O(1) peek
 * - Fallible operations return result__Bool_Error
 * - Typed peek/pop return option_T via DEFINE_PRIORITY_QUEUE(T)
 * - bytes_t view of current contents via pq_as_bytes()
 *
 * NULL contract (uniform across all functions):
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * - A NULL PriorityQueue* is a silent no-op for void functions
 * - Query functions return 0, false, or a safe sentinel for NULL input
 * - Invalid arguments on a valid non-NULL PriorityQueue* fire require_msg —
 *   these are programming errors, not recoverable conditions
 *
 * Min-heap vs max-heap:
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * - Min-heap (default): pass algo_cmp_i32 or any ascending comparator
 * - Max-heap: pass algo_cmp_i32_desc or any descending comparator
 *
 * Typed usage (recommended):
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Use DEFINE_PRIORITY_QUEUE(T) to get a fully type-safe wrapper that
 * returns option_T from pop/peek instead of raw void* out-params.
 * Requires CANON_OPTION(T) to be instantiated first.
 *
 * Lifetime tracking (define CANON_LIFETIME_DEBUG before including):
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   - Embeds a lifetime_t lt field on the PriorityQueue struct. The field
 *     is inherited transparently by every DEFINE_PRIORITY_QUEUE(T) typed
 *     wrapper — typed wrappers just contain `PriorityQueue _pq` and read
 *     `h->_pq.lt` exactly like any other field.
 *   - pq_init opens a fresh lifetime. The ID is derived from a per-TU
 *     monotonic counter XOR'd with the constructor's address (same pattern
 *     as vec/deque — defensive against any future shift to a value-return
 *     constructor shape).
 *   - PriorityQueue has NO destructor. The buffer is caller-owned and the
 *     struct is caller-allocated; there is no hook on which to call close.
 *     The lifetime stays open for the life of the struct. Use-of-PQ-
 *     after-the-struct-goes-out-of-scope is the caller's responsibility,
 *     not the substrate's. (Same contract as deque.)
 *   - Restamp-on-mutation: every operation that can change the element
 *     at index 0 — push_result, pop_raw, remove_at_result, heapify — re-
 *     derives lt.id at the end of the operation (on the success path).
 *     A borrow that captured the previous id (e.g. against the address
 *     returned by pq_peek_raw before the mutation) reads the new id at
 *     the same &pq->lt address and mismatches — invalidation by id-bump,
 *     analogous to vec's swap-via-struct-copy semantics.
 *   - Operations that do NOT restamp: peek_raw/peek, queries (len,
 *     capacity, remaining, is_empty, is_full, as_bytes). The bool legacy
 *     wrappers (pq_push, pq_pop, pq_peek, pq_remove_at) inherit the
 *     restamp transitively through the result variants they delegate to.
 *   - Internal helpers (pq_swap_, pq_sift_up_, pq_sift_down_) deliberately
 *     do NOT restamp. The restamp belongs at the public-operation
 *     boundary so a single push (which may call sift_up many times)
 *     produces exactly one id bump, not one per internal swap.
 *   Zero cost in release builds — struct layout is identical without
 *   the flag.
 *
 * Dependency rule:
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * data/priority_queue.h is in data/ — depends on core/ and semantics/.
 *
 * Thread-safety:
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * NOT thread-safe. Caller must synchronize if shared across threads.
 *
 * Performance:
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * - pq_push / pq_push_result:           O(log n)
 * - pq_pop_raw / pq_pop:                O(log n)
 * - pq_peek_raw / pq_peek:              O(1)
 * - pq_remove_at / pq_remove_at_result: O(log n)
 * - pq_heapify:                         O(n) — Floyd's algorithm
 * - pq_as_bytes:                        O(1)
 *
 * Quick start:
 * ```c
 * CANON_OPTION(int)
 * DEFINE_PRIORITY_QUEUE(int)
 *
 * int buf[64];
 * pq_int h;
 * pq_int_init(&h, buf, 64, algo_cmp_i32, NULL);
 * pq_int_push_result(&h, 42);
 * pq_int_push_result(&h, 7);
 *
 * option_int top = pq_int_pop_option(&h);  // Some(7) — min-heap
 * ```
 *
 * @sa core/primitives/compare.h — algo_cmp_fn and built-in comparators
 * @sa core/primitives/lifetime.h — canonical home of region_id_t and lifetime_t
 * @sa semantics/option/option.h — option_T for typed peek/pop
 * @sa semantics/result/result.h — result__Bool_Error for fallible operations

   Field is conditionally injected via PQ_LIFETIME_FIELD_. Helpers are
   conditionally defined; in release builds they are empty no-ops (and the
   field doesn't exist on the struct).

   PriorityQueue is a single base struct shared across all typed wrappers —
   so a single pair of file-scoped helpers (open + restamp) suffices for
   every DEFINE_PRIORITY_QUEUE(T) instantiation. Unlike vec/deque, no
   per-instantiation helper is needed because nothing in this module
   token-pastes against the lifetime helper name.

   Restamp uses the same counter-mixed derivation as open. The result is
   a fresh id distinct from the previous one (the counter monotonically
   increments) — borrows that captured the old id now mismatch.

 * ACSL: structural invariant and scope (VERIFY-022, commit 7 — runs 1-6 at CI #1282-#1288 scored, see the job)
 *
 * WHAT IS CLAIMED: the STRUCTURAL invariant only. A queue is well-formed when
 * its buffer is valid for capacity*elem_size bytes, len <= capacity, and
 * elem_size > 0. Plus exact results for the accessors, and the len arithmetic
 * of push/pop/remove.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED, AND CANNOT BE: HEAP ORDER. pq_sift_up_ and
 * pq_sift_down_ decide every swap by calling pq->cmp(a, b, ctx) — an indirect
 * call through a CALLER-SUPPLIED function pointer. WP reasons about an
 * indirect call only through a `calls` clause that enumerates its possible
 * targets (it says so in the run-0 log: "no 'calls' specification ...
 * Assuming that they can call 'pq_sift_down_'"), and `\valid_function` is
 * unimplemented. The base layer's comparator is any function the caller
 * chooses, so no finite target list exists to write; without one WP treats
 * the call as an unknown callee — possibly non-terminating, assigning
 * everything, possibly recursive. "parent <= child" is therefore a statement
 * about an uninterpreted function, and asserting it would be asserting
 * something the prover cannot connect to the code. (The DEFINE_PRIORITY_QUEUE
 * typed wrappers DO have an enumerable comparator set — the algo_cmp_* family
 * — so a `calls` clause is writable for them; that is a separate, later pass
 * and does not lift the ceiling on the base layer.)
 *
 * This is not a timeout and no budget touches it. It is the same ceiling that
 * produced option's 32 and result's 28 dispatch residuals, met here for the
 * first time in a container whose CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT depends on it — vec and
 * deque are ordered by insertion, so their specs never needed the comparator.
 * A priority queue's whole point is the ordering, and the ordering is the part
 * that cannot be specified.
 *
 * Recorded as a specification-strength ceiling, VERIFY-020 F4 family, declared
 * before the run rather than discovered in the residual count.
 *
 * COMMIT 5 UPDATE. The FRAME half of this ceiling -- "WP treats the call as
 * an unknown callee, assigning everything" -- is closed for the verified
 * configuration by pq_cmp_ (see its banner): a `calls` clause over the 24
 * proved built-in comparators makes the call's purity a theorem. The ORDER
 * half stands: the built-ins ensure only -1 <= \result <= 1, so "parent <=
 * child" is still not statable. What changed is that WP now knows the queue
 * is intact after a comparison; it still knows nothing about which way the
 * comparison went.
 *
 * The heap order is covered instead by the runtime suite: every pop sequence
 * in priority_queue_test.c asserts ascending order, including through the
 * byte-wise swap path for elements over CANON_MEM_SWAP_MAX.

 * At CI #1285 that cascade was ~99 of 144 own residuals. The comparator call
 * was an information horizon.
 *
 * TWO WAYS TO CLOSE IT WERE CONSIDERED, and the second was chosen:
 *
 *   (a) A TRUSTED AXIOM: contract this wrapper `assigns \nothing` and leave
 *       its own goal unprovable as the permanent marker -- diag.h's stdio
 *       axiom shape (VERIFY-017). Covers any comparator; proves nothing
 *       about it.
 *
 *   (b) A VERIFIED CONFIGURATION: a `calls` clause naming compare.h's 24
 *       built-in comparators, and a requires that pq->cmp is one of them.
 *       All 24 are proved -- VERIFY-005, 208/208, zero residuals -- with
 *       `assigns \nothing`, byte-form validity requires, and a bounded
 *       result. This wrapper's frame and termination then follow from THEIR
 *       contracts: a theorem, not an assumption. lifetime.h's shape,

 *
 * (b) is what is below. The one goal expected to remain unprovable is
 * \valid_function(pq->cmp), unimplemented in Frama-C 29 -- the same single
 * goal every function-pointer call in the project carries.
 *
 * NOT claimed: anything about the comparator's RESULT beyond -1..1. Heap
 * order still cannot be stated here, and the runtime suite remains the
 * evidence for ordering. This wrapper changes what WP knows about the queue
 * AFTER a comparison, not what it knows about the comparison.
 *
 * Shipped code: three call sites change from pq->cmp(a, b, pq->ctx) to
 * pq_cmp_(pq, a, b). static inline; identical machine code; no conditions
 * added, so MC/DC's denominator does not move.

 * @brief Swaps two elements in the heap. INTERNAL.
 *
 * Trailing underscore as of 2026-09: this and pq_sift_up_, pq_sift_down_,
 * pq_parent_, pq_left_child_ and pq_right_child_ were plain public symbols
 * until then, while this same header already marked pq_lifetime_next_id_,
 * pq_lifetime_open_ and pq_lifetime_restamp_ internal by that convention.
 * The rule existed here and had not been applied to the heap internals.
 *
 * The exposure was not cosmetic. Demonstrated on the pre-rename header:
 * a client calling pq_swap(&q, 0, 4) on a queue holding 1..5 leaves
 * pq_peek returning 3 where the minimum is 1 - the heap invariant broken
 * silently, no error, no diagnostic. And because this function
 * deliberately does not restamp (see below), a client call mutates
 * contents WITHOUT bumping the lifetime id, so an outstanding borrow keeps
 * validating against a queue that changed underneath it. The instrument
 * fails OPEN, the same mode VERIFY-021 was written to prevent in the token
 * generator.
 *
 * Verified before renaming: one caller outside this header — the test
 * test_self_swap_is_a_noop in test/, which called pq_swap directly and was
 * deleted rather than adapted (see MCDC-014 in docs/deviations.md). None in
 * other headers. The rename is therefore contained, and no deprecation shim
 * is provided.
 *
 * Consequence for coverage: the `a == b` early return is now dead by
 * construction. pq_sift_down_ only calls this when smallest != idx, and
 * pq_sift_up_ swaps a parent with a child at idx > 0, so a self-swap
 * cannot arise from the heap's own operations. It takes an MC/DC
 * justification row rather than a test.
 *
 * @pre pq != NULL
 * @pre a < pq->len && b < pq->len
 *
 * Lifetime: does NOT restamp. The restamp belongs at the public-operation
 * boundary so a single push/pop produces exactly one id bump, not one per
 * internal swap.

   Generates a type-safe pq_T wrapper over PriorityQueue.
   Pop and peek return option_T instead of raw void* out-params.

   Requires CANON_OPTION(type) to be instantiated before expanding this macro.

   The typed wrapper just contains a PriorityQueue _pq member — the lt

   the base struct. No per-type lifetime helpers needed.

   Usage:
   ```c
   CANON_OPTION(int)
   DEFINE_PRIORITY_QUEUE(int)

   int buf[64];
   pq_int h;
   pq_int_init(&h, buf, 64, algo_cmp_i32, NULL);
   pq_int_push_result(&h, 42);
   pq_int_push_result(&h, 7);

   option_int top = pq_int_pop_option(&h);  // Some(7) — min-heap
   if (option_int_is_some(top)) {
       printf("%d\n", option_int_unwrap(top));
   }
   ```
